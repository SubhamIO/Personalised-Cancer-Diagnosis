<h6> Problem statement : </h6>
<p> Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. </p>

## Data Overview

- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data
- We have two data files: one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that  human experts/pathologists use to classify the genetic mutations. 
- Both these data files are have a common column called ID
- <p> 
    Data file's information:
    <ul> 
        <li>
        training_variants (ID , Gene, Variations, Class)
        </li>
        <li>
        training_text (ID, Text)
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

## Posing as ML Problem
<p>
    
            There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified into => Multi class classification problem
